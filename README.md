# nodewebapp-skeleton
Node web app skeleton for use with mongodb

This is largely based on following the tutorial found here: https://github.com/kacole2/express-node-mongo-skeleton/blob/master/views/blobs/index.jade

I have update the resources and put the index view into a table to look prettier. My goal is to fill out the rest of the
skeleton app to provide a learning template for using Node.js Express framework for building websites.
